Frontend United, formerly known as Drupal Design Camp, is a yearly European conference that moves from country to country. Its aim is to bring front-end developers, designers and Drupal themers from all kinds of backgrounds closer together and share knowledge, experiences and ideas face-to-face. Frontend United looks to help grow the local community as well as build bridges across Europe for further collaborations and cross-border exchange.
