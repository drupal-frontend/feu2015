      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p><strong>Trains: </strong>Bristol Temple Meads station is the main station and in the City centre. If you're going straight to the venue it will be a 40 minute walk - so it might be best to get a taxi or bus from outside the station.</p>
      <p><strong>Buses: </strong>There is a strong bus <a href="http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/bristol_bath/journey_planning/timetables/timetable.php?day=2&source_id=2&service=70/71&routeid=12253791&operator=3&source=sp">network in Bristol</a> with a dayrider ticket costing £4.40 giving you unlimited travel for one day right through until 4.29am the following morning. There are buses throughout the night, but less frequently so do keep an eye on the timetable. The number 70 or 71 will get to you Hamilton House.</p> 
      <p><strong>Walking: </strong>Bristol is a compact city and most places are within a short walk. We do however recommend that if you have problems with walking that you catch the bus from Hamilton House to the After Party at The Rummer as it may take about 30 minutes. </p>
      <p><strong>Parking: </strong>There very limited parking at Hamilton House and we have to pay for a permit to park so unless you've a valid reason there isn't parking at the venue. If you're disabled or feel you need a parking space please email Justine on info@frontendunited.org</p>
      <h2>Accommodation</h2>
      <p>There are plenty of hotels in Bristol city centre ranging from budget to boutique. You should expect to pay about £80 per night for a budget hotel. There are also hostels around the Quay and airBnB is popular here.</p>
