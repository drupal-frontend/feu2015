    <h1>Bristol baby!</h1>
    <p>In June we’re heading to <a href="http://www.hamiltonhouse.org/">Hamilton House in Bristol</a> and we want you to join us for a weekend of Drupal’s Frontend and all its dangly bits. Awesome talks where design and Drupal meet and make warm fuzzies in your belly. Plus some Drupal sprinting thrown in! </p>
